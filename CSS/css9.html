                development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web
                applications,
                electronic businesses, and social network services.

                Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These
                cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
                money
                from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
