        <h2>Story 2</h2>
        <p>Once, in the sacred forests of Kailash, Lord Shiva, known as Shankar Bhagwan, embarked on a profound meditation. His deep trance summoned a majestic lion, Garjan, who approached with reverence.</p>

        <p>Garjan, born of Shiva's divine energy, sought wisdom. Shankar Bhagwan, pleased by the lion's devotion, imparted profound teachings. Garjan learned the art of strength combined with compassion, symbolizing Shiva's attributes.</p>

        <p> Years passed, and Garjan roamed the world, protecting the weak and defending righteousness. He became a symbol of courage and benevolence. Shankar Bhagwan smiled, for Garjan embodied the harmonious balance of strength and compassion, a reflection of the divine himself.</p>
