                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Now, there lived a newly married woman in his neighborhood. Her husband was
                not very good, so she got attracted to him. Since both houses were adjacent
                to each other, they could go to each other's house easily. Once that woman's
                husband went to foreign lands, so she was alone. She thought to go to that
                boy's room.

                boy's room. She knew the room of that boy. He was awake at that time. He
                got stunned to see a woman's figure at his room's door. He asked her - "Who
                are you?" That woman didn't reply anything, just came near his bed and said
                - "I am your beloved." and she lay down beside him. The boy got scared. The
                woman requested to love her, but that boy took her as a witch and got
                unconscious. The woman also got scared seeing him unconscious.

                was also among those thieves. He used to say at home, that he was going to
                foreign lands, but he used to steal during those days. He told the stolen
                things as his business profit and impressed his neighbors.
