                She was very beautiful. As she grew up, many proposals came for her, but the
                king of Avantee was unable to decide to whom to marry his daughter. After a

                    gatekeeper informed him that the prince of Chol Desh wanted to see him. The
                    king called him with respect and asked the reason of his coming. He expressed
                    his desire to marry the princess. Chol Desh was a very mighty kingdom in
                    those times, so the king had to think about it. He said to him - "Please you
                    stay in our special guest house, we will consult the princess and then only we
                    can reply you. By the way what is your specialty?" The prince said - "I am a
                    good archer. I can shoot "Shabd-Vedhee" (shooting an arrow just only
                    listening by sound) arrow and I don't miss my target." And the prince was
