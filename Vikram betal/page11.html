                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vaitaal said - "The princess of Magadh Desh, Chandralekaa was very
                    beautiful. As she grew up, many princes proposed to marry her, but she
                    refused to marry anyone. Then one day her mother asked - "Do you want to
                    marry or no?" "Yes, I will marry, but only when I will get an appropriate boy."
                    Mother again asked her - "So there is no boy appropriate for you among
                    them?" "No." "Then who will be the appropriate boy for you?" "Who is mighty
                    and can protect his wife." Mother said - "OK, Then only you decide to whom
                    you want to marry." The princess agreed.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;After some time a prince's proposal came, the princess asked - "What is your
                    quality?" The prince said - "I can see past, present and future." The princess
                    didn't reply him anything. After that another proposal came. The princess
                    asked him the same question, he said - "I have a chariot which can run
                    anywhere - on water, in air, on road, and I have built it myself." After that
                    another proposal came and the princess asked him the same question. He said
                    - "I have a sword whose hit never misses, and nobody can save himself from
                    it."

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Some other proposals also came, but the princess was unable to decide. Her
                    mother was very worried with this. She told her that she would tell her her
                    decision next day.
                    By chance those three princes, who told her their qualities, came next day.
                    The first prince's name was Veerendra, the second one's name was Udayaveer
                    and the third one's name was Dhananjaya. The princess asked them to wait.
                    In the meantime the princess got disappeared. Everybody got worried about
                    the princess.
