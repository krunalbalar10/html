                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;There were two young men, Madan and Ratan, in Baatee island. Both were
                very fast friends. Once both went to do business together. They made a lot
                of profit. While returning, they sat down under a tree and started counting
                their remaining things and profit. They were busy in their work, that a
                beautiful woman came there.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Both looked at her surprisingly and asked her - "O Beautiful, Who are you?"
                She told the she was going with her husband that some robbers robbed them
                and killed her husband. After saying this she broke into tears and started
                crying loudly. She said - "Since now there is nobody for me to go - there
                was no use to go to my parents and other relations, I will commit suicide."

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Madan and Ratan consoled her and assured her to provide every kind of help
                she needed. Woman got consoled. Their work was over so they took her along
                and started their journey. Both were thinking about her, as what to do of
                her.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Madan suggested that she should be remarried. Ratan said - "Maybe one of us
                can marry her." "But how?" Ratan said - "If you are interested, you may
                marry her." Madan said - "Yes, I can marry, but if you want, you can marry
                her." Madan again said - "Look, We both are interested to marry her. So, let
                us play the dice game and decide who will marry her. Then we will not have
                any complaint with each other." Ratan agreed.
