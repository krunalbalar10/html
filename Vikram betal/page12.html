                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;This time Vikram got very angry with him. He again came after him, caught
                    him, put him on his shoulder and started walking. Vikram said angrily - "You
                    34
                    deceive me, Vaitaal? I will cut your head. Why do you run all the time?"
                    Vaitaal first didn't say anything, but after a while he said - "Why are you so
                    angry?" Vikram said - "Why do you run away?" I run because of your correct
                    answer. What was our condition? Do you remember? That you will not speak at
                    all." Vikram said - "But when you talk about justice, then I have to speak.
                    You know that it is my nature." Vaitaal said - "Then running away is my
                    nature." and he laughed heartily. "OK Listen now, I tell you a story just to
                    pass time." Vaitaal started his story and Vikram listened quietly.

                    the correct judgment, otherwise your head will split and scattered away in
                    pieces, you know that. This is my Shaap to you " Vikram nodded silently.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vaitaal started - "Once upon a time, there lived a rich man in Avanteepur. His
                    name was Gunvant. He was very religious. His wife was very beautiful but was
                    very wicked. She gave birth to a daughter who was from some other man, and
                    that is why she was more beautiful. After some time she grew up and became
                    like her mother. Her name was Ratnaavatee. Her father started looking a boy
                    for her, but in the meantime, she had illegal relations with her servant.
                    Hearing this Gunvant sacked his servant. He went away and started living at
                    another place.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;But Ratnaavatee still continued to see him. She used to go in night and come
                    back in night. Only her mother knew about this affair. In the meantime
                    Gunvant had searched a good match for her and married her to him.

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;When a soldier distinguished himself in action, he raised him to the powers
                        and privileges of the warrior caste. And whereas it had been the habit to lavish circles and
                        bars of silver and other metals upon all those who had joined in the war, whether they had
                        19
                        sat behind a heap of sand or had been foremost to attack the foe, he broke through the
                        pernicious custom, and he rendered the honour valuable by conferring it only upon the
                        deserving. I need hardly say that, in an inordinately short space of time, his army beat
                        every king and general that opposed it.
