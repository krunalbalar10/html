                    Vaitaal started telling him a story -
                    "Listen O King, Once upon a time, there ruled a king in Vaaraanasee city. He had a son
                    named Vajramukut. King had a minister who also had a son named Ratnraaj. Both were very
                    good friends. They both were seen together. They used to go together for hunting too.
                    Once they went to a forest for hunting, but got separated while they were following their
                    deer. After some time, Vajramukut sensed that he had come very far, and now he should go
                    back. So he turned back without hunting the deer.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;When he was coming back, he saw a beautiful palace. It looked like a king's
                    palace. There
                    was a beautiful garden also beside the palace. Many kinds of flowers were blooming there.
                    There was a small temple also in the garden. Prince was very tired, so he came in the
                    garden with the idea that he would take some rest there. He was about to lie down there,
                    that the gardener of that garden came and said to him - "O traveler, You go from here
                    because the princess is just about to come here to worship. If she saw you here, she would
                    scold me." Prince said - "OK, I will go from here." Gardener went away assured that the
                    prince would go away. Prince also started preparing his horse to go from there.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;In the meantime, the princess came there with her friends to worship in that
                    temple.
                    Vajramukut got stunned to see her and continued looking at her. She was very beautiful. He
                    has never seen such a beautiful girl before. She went to the temple to worship and when
                    she came back she saw the prince standing there. She also got attracted to him.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;She picked up the lotus flower from her head which she brought from the temple,
                    touched
                    it with her ears, bit it by her teeth, put it under her foot and then touched it with her
                    heart. Vajramukut was still looking at her. The princess went away, so he also came back.
                    He was very sad as he was unable to forget the princess. On the way he met his friend
                    Ratnraaj.
