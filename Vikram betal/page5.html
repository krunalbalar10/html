                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; It was a dark night and was raining from time to time.Gusts of wind shook
                        the
                        trees. There were strange noises and in between the thunderclaps the moaning of
                        jackals could be heard.Flashes of lightning revealed fearsome faces and there were
                        strange and mysterious laughter of the spirits.
                        But inspite of such a weird atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not
                        swerve a bit. He climbed the ancient tree to bring the corpse down
                        and soon he began crossing the desolate cremation ground, with the
                        corpse lying on his shoulder.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The Betaal that possessed the corpse spoke: "O King , I pity you as
                        you are making untiring efforts without relaxing as if you wish to
                        achieve something.Instead of enjoying a comfortable sleep on a cozy
                        bed, you're still coming after me. You seem to be quite adamant. Such
                        arrogance may not help you keep your promise if you had given one to anybody.
                        You'll realize the futility of the whole thing if only you listen to my story."

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The Betaal then narrated this story.The ruler of Kishanagar, Rajendra, was
                        extremely strong and courageous. He was a good ruler and cared about his people
                        very much as he would not do anything unjust. His subjects were happy and
                        contented. They had no problems. His queen, Prema, gave birth to a beautiful
                        daughter, Sona
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Being an only child, Sona enjoyed a lot of freedom and was brought up like a
                        boy.
                        She grew up clever not only in studies but in the use of the bow and arrow and
                        12
                        sword. She learnt the art of self-defence. When she reached marriageable age, her
                        parents began searching for a suitable husband for her.
                        But Sona disagreed to their proposal as she had some definite
                        ideas and views.
                        She said to her parents that ,"Dear Father, I want that my
                        husband should be one who is highly skilled in fighting and who
                        is able to overpower, me in fight.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <p align="justify">
                        Suppose if our kingdom face an enemy in the future, he should
                        be able to fight & defeat them in war. If you agree to this
                        condition then, you may make an announcement".
                        The King & Queen were very proud to hear about their daughter's thoughts.The
                        announcement was made in Kishanagar as well as in the neighbouring kingdoms.
                        Thinking that Sona is only a girl,and it should not be a difficult to win a fight with
                        her, many suitors came forward to accept her challenge as they also knew that Sona
                        being the only heir they would have complete sway over the kingdom once they
                        married her.
