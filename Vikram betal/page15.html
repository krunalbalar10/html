                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;As Vikramaaditya walked away from the tree, Vaitaal again started speaking -
                    "Listen now, and do not be angry. Your justice is very good that is why I like
                    to talk to you, it increases my knowledge." Vikram didn't say a word and
                    continued to walk. Vaitaal also continued his talking, he said - "Now I tell you
                    a story just to pass time, listen to it and do justice." Vaitaal started his
                    story and Vikram started listening.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vaitaal said - "There lived a rich man in Ujjayinee Nagaree. He had only one
                    son. His name was Gandharvsen. He was very handsome, like a prince. He used
                    to go to city riding on a horse. Many girls were attracted to him, but he
                    didn't like any of them. By chance, one day he went to that side of city
                    where washermen were washing the clothes. Suddenly he saw a girl who was
                    washing her clothes with full attention. He instantly fell in love with her. He
                    gazed at her for a few moments, then sat on the steps of a nearby temple.
                    He sat there till sunset. All washermen had gone from there after loading
                    their clothes on donkeys.

                    most
                    fastidious?
                    Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The third son, as he had definite evidence wit
                    that red mark. The other two could have obtained information from elsewhere too."

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Gandharvsen got very sad. Then he got up and said to Devee in the temple,
                    "If I am married to this girl, I will offer my head to you after one month."
                    And he came back to his home. He was not able to forget that girl even for a
                    moment. He fell sick. His family got worried about him. Several Vaidya
                    (traditional doctors) came to see him but nobody was able to identify any
                    disease.
