                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;It was a dark night and was raining from time to time. Gusts of wind shook
                    the trees. There were strange noises and in between the thunderclaps the
                    moaning of jackals could be heard. Flashes of lightning revealed fearsome
                    faces and there were strange and mysterious laughter of the spirits.
                    But in spite of such a weird atmosphere king Vikramaditya did
                    not swerve a bit. He climbed the ancient tree to bring the
                    corpse down and soon he began crossing the desolate cremation
                    ground, with the corpse lying on his shoulder.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The Betaal that possessed the corpse spoke: "O King, I pity you as you
                    are making untiring efforts without relaxing as if you wish to achieve
                    something. Instead of enjoying a comfortable sleep on a cozy bed, you're still
                    coming after me. You seem to be quite adamant. Such arrogance may not help
                    you keep your promise if you had given one to anybody. You'll realize the
                    futility of the whole thing if only you listen to my story." And the vampire
                    began his narration.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <font color="red">Long long ago,</font> Kanchannagar was being ruled by King Chandradeep . His
                    daughter was Indumati. Being an only child, the princess was brought up like a
                    boy, and given training in the use of arms and warfare. It was certain that
                    whoever wed her would also become the ruler of Kanchannagar. The princes of
                    many of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a desire to marry Indumati, who
                    was, besides everything else, extremely beautiful.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Whenever the king broached the subject of marriage,
                    Princess Indumati, would hesitate to give him a definite
                    answer, but one day Indumati said yes to his father, "Yes,
                    father, but...". The king stared at her, waiting for her to
                    complete the sentence.
                    â€œWhoever marries me must be strong and brave. And he
                    must succeed in the tests that I give." Indumati then spelt
                    out what kind of tests she was contemplating for her
                    suitors.
