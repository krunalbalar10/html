                            Now listen to another story. There was a rich man lived in Gaandhaar Desh.
                            His name was Brahmdatt. He had only one wife and had made the rule for
                            others also not to marry more than one wife. Women were very happy with
                            this arrangement. Brahmdatt had a son named Somdatt. He was very
                            handsome and unmarried.

                            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;One day Somdatt went out in the city and halted in front of a temple. After
                            a while a beautiful woman came out of the temple. Somdatt fell in love with
                            her. That woman also saw him, smiled and went away shyly. Somdatt came
                            back and thought about that woman. He took the help of his friends and found
                            out about her. She was the daughter of the king's minister and her name was
                            Chandrasenaa. Somdatt sent his proposal to marry her to her parents but
                            they refused it because she was already engaged to some other man, named
                            Jayakarn.
