                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;In the venerable city of Bardwan, O warrior king! (quoth the Vampire) during the
                    reign of
                    the mighty Rupsen, flourished one Rajeshwar, a Rajput warrior of distinguished fame. By his
                    valour and conduct he had risen from the lowest ranks of the army to command it as its
                    captain. And arrived at that dignity, he did not put a stop to all improvements, like other
                    chiefs, who rejoice to rest and return thanks. On the contrary, he became such a reformer
                    that, to some extent, he remodelled the art of war.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Instead of attending to rules and regulations, drawn up in their studies by pandits and
                    Brahmans, he consulted chiefly his own experience and judgment. He threw aside the
                    systematic plans of campaigns laid down in the Shastras or books of the ancients, and he
                    acted upon the spur of the moment. He displayed a skill in the choice of ground, in the use
                    of light troops, and in securing his own supplies whilst he cut off those of the enemy, which
                    Kartikaya himself, God of War, might have envied. Finding that the bows of his troops were
                    clumsy and slow to use, he had them all changed before compelled so to do by defeat; he
                    also gave his attention to the sword handles, which cramped the men's grasp but which
                    having been used for eighteen hundred years were considered perfect weapons. And having
                    organized a special corps of warriors using fire arrows, he soon brought it to such
                    perfection that, by using it against the elephants of his enemies, he gained many a
                    campaign.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;One instance of his superior judgment I am about to quote to thee, O Vikram, after which I
                    return to my tale; for thou art truly a warrior king, very likely to imitate the innovations of
                    the great general Rajeshwar.

                    Kshatriya warriors, who grew great only because they grew old and - fat. Thus the energy
                    and talent of the younger men were wasted in troubles and disorders; whilst the seniors
                    were often so ancient that they could not mount their chargers unaided, nor, when they
                    were mounted, could they see anything a dozen yards before them. But they had served in a
                    certain obsolete campaign, and until Rajeshwar gave them pensions and dismissals, they
                    claimed a right to take first part in all campaigns present and future. The commander-in-
                    chief refused to use any captain who could not stand steady on his legs, or endure the sun
                    for a whole day.

                        When a soldier distinguished himself in action, he raised him to the powers
                        and privileges of the warrior caste. And whereas it had been the habit to lavish circles and
                        bars of silver and other metals upon all those who had joined in the war, whether they had
                        19
                        sat behind a heap of sand or had been foremost to attack the foe, he broke through the
                        pernicious custom, and he rendered the honour valuable by conferring it only upon the
                        deserving. I need hardly say that, in an inordinately short space of time, his army beat
                        every king and general that opposed it.
