                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;When the pyre of the cremation ground was in sight, Vaitaal said to Vikram -
"Vikram, This Yogee is very cunning. He is planning to kill you. I know his plan.
He will ask you to prostrate, and when you will prostrate before him, he will
cut your neck with sword. So be careful."

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vikram got surprised to hear this. Although he had this doubt in his mind, but
                now he was more careful. Vikram came to the Yogee with Vaitaal on his
                shoulder. Yogee became very happy to see Vaitaal, he said - "Bravo king
                Vikram, You are really courageous. Now you will rule the whole Prithvi without
                any obstacles."

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The Yogee cut the body of Vaitaal into pieces and sacrificed it in the fire,
                performed some Taantrik rites, and in the last offered Poorn Aahuti (last
                Aahuti). Vikram was noticing all this very carefully. He was standing just
                straight. After finishing everything, the Yogee said - "King Vikram, Now you
                earn Punya by prostrating in front of me.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vikram was waiting for this moment only. He remembered Vaitaal's
                instruction, that "as you will prostrate in front of him, he will cut your neck."
                so he said - "I am a king, I do not prostrate in front of anybody. The Yogee
                got surprised to hear this. He said - "OK, Then I prostrate before you." As
                he bent down to prostrate before the king, the king cut his neck with his
                sword. The Yogee was dead.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The then a loud laughter echoed in that lonely forest. That laughter was of
                that Vaitaal. Vikram got stunned to see Vaitaal, he exclaimed - "Vaitaal you?
                You were dead?" Vaitaal said - "Yes, It is me. By sacrificing this Yogee, you
                have given me life. If you had not killed him, I could not have been born
                again."
