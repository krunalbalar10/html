                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; In days gone by, Vikramaditya, a great king ruled over a prosperous kingdom
                        from his capital at Ujjain.
                        Mighty as the sun - he was a king with immense love for learning as well as for adventure.

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; King Vikram sat in his court for hours every
                        day, rewarding the virtuous, punishing the evil
                        doers, and encouraging scholars, poets,
                        musicians, and artists.During such sessions, numerous people came to
                        meet him. They brought for him gifts of
                        jewels, gold or other precious things.

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Among such visitors was a mendicant who, on every visit, presented the king
                        with a fruit. The king accepted his humble gift with the same show of
                        courtesy with which he would have accepted a diamond from a rich merchant.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;He used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One morning, the
                        mendicant gave him his usual gift just when the king was going out to inspect
                        his stables. The king accepted the fruit all right and went out while playing
                        with it, tossing it up and then catching it as it came down.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;It so happened that after a while the fruit fell down from his hand.
                        Instantly
                        a monkey who was on a nearby tree swooped down upon it and tried to crack it
                        with his teeth.The fruit broke and pop came out a handy ball of ruby. The king's surprise
                        knew no bounds. He picked up the ruby and sent for an expert.
