                                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vikramaaditya had held Vaitaal tightly. He was very angry with
                                    Vaitaal.
                                    Vaitaal said - "Why are you so angry with me?" "Why do you trouble me so
                                    much? Why do you run away like this every time?" "You don't worry, whatever
                                    I am doing, I am doing for your good only. A time will come when you will feel
                                    obliged to me. OK, Now listen to another story, so that we pass our time
                                    easily. If you will not reply in spite of knowing, your head will split and
                                    scatter all around, you know that." Vikram did not say anything, he listened to
                                    him quietly.

                                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vaitaal started his story - "There lived a learned Braahman,
                                    named
                                    Choodaavat, in Choodaapur city. He had a son whose name was Bhadraavat. He
                                    was also learned like his father. When he grew up, his father started looking
                                    for a girl for him, but he could not marry him in his life time. After the
                                    death of his father, Bhadraavat maintained the respect of his father. But
                                    only a few people can control their desires.
