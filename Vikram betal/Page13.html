            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The Baital said, O king, in the Gaur country, Vardhman by name, there is a
            city, and one called Gunshekhar was the Raja of that land. His minister was
            one Abhaichand, a Jain, by whose teachings the king also came into the Jain
            faith.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The worship of Shiva and of Vishnu, gifts of cows, gifts of lands, gifts of
            rice balls, gaming and spirit-drinking, all these he prohibited. In the city no
            man could get leave to do them, and as for bones, into the Ganges no man was
            allowed to throw them, and in these matters the minister, having taken orders
            from the king, caused a proclamation to be made about the city, saying,
            "Whoever these acts shall do, the Raja having confiscated, will punish him and
            banish him from the city."
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Now one day the Diwan[169] began to say to the Raja, "O great king, to the
            decisions of the Faith be pleased to give ear. Whosoever takes the life of
            another, his life also in the future birth is taken: this very sin causes him to
            be born again and again upon earth and to die And thus he ever continues to
            be born again and to die. Hence for one who has found entrance into this
            world to cultivate religion is right and proper. Be pleased to behold! By love,
            by wrath, by pain, by desire, and by fascination overpowered, the gods
            Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahadeva (Shiva) in various ways upon the earth are ever
            becoming incarnate. Far better than they is the Cow, who is free from
            passion, enmity, drunkenness, anger, covetousness, and inordinate affection,
            who supports mankind, and whose progeny in many way
            s give ease and solace to
            the creatures of the world These deities and sages (munis) believe in the
            Cow.[170]

            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The minister having in this manner explained to the king the sentiments of his
            own mind, so brought him over to the Jain faith, that whatever he said, so
            the king did. Thus in Brahmans, in Jogis, in Janganis, in Sevras, in
            Sannyasis,[172] and in religious mendicants, no man believed, and according to
            this creed the rule was carried on.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;"For such reason to believe in the gods is not good. Upon this earth be
            pleased to believe in the Cow. It is our duty to protect the life of everyone,
            beginning from the elephant, through ants, beasts, and birds, up to man. In
            the world righteousness equal to that there is none. Those who, eating the
            flesh of other creatures, increase their own flesh, shall in the fulness of time
            assuredly obtain the fruition of Narak [17l]; hence for a man it is proper to
            attend to the conversation of life. They who understand not the pain of other
            creatures, and who continue to slay and to devour them, last but few days in
            the land, and return to mundane existence, maimed, limping, one-eyed, blind,
            dwarfed, hunchbacked, and imperfect in such wise. Just as they consume the
            bodies of beasts and of birds, even so they end by spoiling their own bodies.
            From drinking spirits also the great sin arises, hence the consuming of spirits
            and flesh is not advisable."
