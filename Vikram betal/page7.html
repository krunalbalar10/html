                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Once upon a time there lived a king of Ujjayani by name of Dharmadhvaja, who had
                    three
                    exquisitely sensitive queens. He loved all three of them very much, all of them were of
                    unparalleled beauty.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;On one occasion, while the king was playing with the first queen, he ruffled her
                    hair. The
                    lotus flower on her ear fell over her thigh, and made a wound and she cried out loud. The
                    king was surprised at her sensitivity and immediately requested medical attention for her.

                    the roof of
                    his palace, the queen suddenly felt her skin burning of the moonlight. The king ordered
                    medical attention for her too and was again surprised at her sensitivity.

                    on hearing
                    of the sound of a mortar grinding rice, far far away. The king immediately ordered medical
                    attention for her and was surprised too.
                    Since then he took utmost care of his three ultra sensitive queens

                    is the
                    most sensitive?
                    Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The third one, as she had not even been touched by
                    the light or flower. She had only heard a noise from distance."
