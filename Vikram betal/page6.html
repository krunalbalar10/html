                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Once upon a time there lived four sons of a poor brahmin who taught them all
                        the
                        Vedas and the holy scriptures. On their parents death, they decided to go and stay with
                        their mother's father. But on reaching there they found that they were unwelcome
                        there and that their cousins were unreceptive to the brothers. Then the brothers
                        decided to each go out into the world and learn a special skill and come back and meet
                        at a common place after a while. So they dispersed and came back to the same place at
                        the appointed time. Each told what he had learnt. The first one said, " I can create
                        flesh of a creature from a single one of the creature". The second one said, " I know
                        how to grow the hair and skin of a creature if it has flesh and bones." The third one
                        said, "I can create the limbs of a creature if its form is complete with skin hair and
                        flesh and bones". The fourth one said, " I know how to give life to that creature once it
                        is complete in form with limbs".

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;So they set off into the forest to find a piece of bone on which they could test
                    their
                    skills. The first one they found was a lion's. So each of them displayed his skill and
                    created a live huge Lion, which as fate would have it, killed all four of them and sped
                    away.

                    brothers is
                    responsible for the death of all of them?
                    Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The fourth one, as he was the one who gave life
                    to the otherwise dead structure of bones flesh and limbs and hair"
