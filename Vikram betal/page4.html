                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Once upon a time there was born a beautiful daughter, Mandaravati, to a very
                    famours priest. When the daughter grew of age, the father was worried about her
                    marriage.Once, three eligible bachelors came to the father and each asked him for
                    the hand of the daughter. Each of them threatened to kill himself lest the daughter
                    be married off to any other of the three. The father decided not to marry her off
                    to anyone.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;One day, she caught a very high pitched fever and died suddenly. All three of
                    them,
                    grief-struck, cremated the body of Mandaravati. One of them decided to stay
                    there and slept on the ashes of Mandaravati. The other took her bones and went to
                    the Ganges. The third became an ascetic and wandered off.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; On one of his wanderings, the third one reached a brahmin's house. The brahmin,
                    by power of a spell, was able to bring the dead alive from the ashes. This was in a
                    book which the brahmin gaurded safely. But the third suitor, in the stealth of night,
                    stole this book and went back to the cremation ground of Mandaravati. The second
                    one had returned from the Ganges with the holy water, and the first one was still
                    there sleeping on the ashes.
                    Then he with the help of the other two, recited the spell from the book and lo
                    Behold!! Mandaravati was reborn! Then the three of them started fighting about
                    11
                    whose wife she should be. Each of them claiming the revival being due to his effort.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three suitors
                    should be the husband of Mandaravati?
                    Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The person who gave her the life by reciting
                    the spell is her creator, it could be her father. The person who took her bones to
                    Ganges shall be her son. But the person who committed himself to the ground and
                    slept on her ashes out of love, can be her husband."
                    As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the tree.
