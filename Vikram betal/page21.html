                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;After a while Vaitaal said - "I am very happy with you Vikram, now I tell you
                another surprising story. It is a real incident. I have witnessed it. There lived
                a king, named Chandraveer, in the city of Chandrahridaya. He was a very
                mighty king. He took a good care of his people. A rich man also lived in the
                same city, his name was Dharmveer. He had daughter, her name was
                Shobhanaa. She was very beautiful. Her father wanted to marry her, but she
                had told him that whenever she would like any boy, she would tell him herself.
                Dharmveer didn't speak anything after that.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Now, a day came that thefts started taking place in that city, but the thief
                was not caught. Then the people requested Chandraveer. He sent all his
                soldiers on vigilance, but still the thefts could not be stopped. People doubted
                that the soldiers were with thieves. People again went to Chandraveer. This
                time Chandraveer decided to vigil himself. This made his soldiers also honest.
                After 3-4 days, when Chandraveer was roaming in the streets of the city, he
                saw a man running away. "Go, and catch him." He ordered his soldiers.
                Soldiers followed him and caught him. He was found with stolen goods. He
                accepted that he was stealing till now and he was the thief. Next day it was
                announced that the thief has been caught and he will be hanged tomorrow
                after giving him a round of the city.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;People got very happy to hear this news. Next day when the thief was taken
                for the round in the city, all people came out to see him. When the thief was
                passing in front of Dharmveer's house, Shobhanaa also saw him. She got
                attracted to the thief. She immediately went to her father and told him that
                she wanted to marry him and he should be saved. Dharmveer got stunned to
                hear this. He tried to explain her but she did not listen to.I have seen this incident myself, still I
                am not able to understand that why
                the thief first wept hearing the news of Shobhanaa's love; and why did he
                laugh at hearing Shobhanaa's becoming Satee with him. In fact it should have
                been otherwise. He should have laughed at the first time and wept at the
                second time.
