                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;As Vikramaaditya was walking fast toward cremation ground, Vaitaal spoke
                    again - "Vikram, What is in a man which makes him different from other living
                    beings and he is regarded the highest among brave people?" Vikram didn't say
                    a word, he continued to move on silently. Vaitaal continued - "OK, Then I tell
                    you a story in this regard.

                    There was a king in Magadh Desh. His name was Shoorsen. He was a very
                    good king. Many kings came in his court just only to see him. People said that
                    his palace was more beautiful than Indra's court

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Once he went for hunting and went far in search of the hunt. He was following
                    a deer. He was a very good horse rider. He had come very far, his people
                    were left far behind. He was alone. Suddenly his deer disappeared. Now he
                    had the chance to look around. It was a very dense lonely forest. He started
                    thinking that in which direction he should go, he couldn't make out so he just
                    started moving in one direction. But the day was getting over, and he was still
                    in the forest. He was hungry and thirsty also. There were many wild animals
                    around him, but he was not afraid of them, the problem was only of his
                    hunger and thirst.

                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The night had fallen by now, he could not move more, so he loosened his
                    horse, tied him with a tree and lay down on the ground. He kept his sword
                    near him. He was worried, he was hungry, and he could not sleep. At about
                    midnight he heard the sound of two lions fighting together for a lioness. He
                    got up, picked his sword and started seeing their fight. A lioness was standing
                    nearby. Suddenly the lioness ran away, so both lions also ran away after her,
                    and the whole atmosphere became quiet again.

                        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The king again lay down and waited for the morning. But in the meantime he
                        heard a sound and he again got up taking his sword. His pearl necklace and
                        diamond and pearl studded sword were shining. He heard a voice - "Who are
                        you?" The king got very happy to hear a man's voice, so he very softly asked
                        him - "First you tell me, who are you?" The man replied - "I am a traveler,
                        but who are you? You look like a king. How have you come here?" "How did you
                        know that I am a king?" "Your shining gems are telling this."
