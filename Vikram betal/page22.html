                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;There lived a religious Braahman in Magadh Desh. He had two sons. Both were
                very learned. The first one could tell by touch only as what was the thing. He
                could tell what was in a safe box just by smelling it. This boy earned money
                by telling things inside the earth. He could tell by smelling the earth where
                the money was kept. People came, took him along with them. He took his fees
                and told them whatever it was. Thus he could tell by smelling the earth that
                whether there will be sweet or salty water if a well was dug there. Wealthy
                people dug their wells on his advice only.

                ill. Both brothers served him very well. The Vaidya (traditional doctor) asked
                them to bring a tortoise so that he could treat him with that. Both brothers
                refused to bring tortoise because of its smell, so a servant was sent to bring
                it. The king's servant took that servant away to the king. Both brothers went
                to get him freed. They pleaded their case.
