                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Vikramaaditya had again lifted Vaitaal, put him on his shoulder and continued
                walking. Vaitaal said - "Vikram, There is lots of time. You will be successful in
                your mission, you will reach the cremation ground in time, but till then let us
                enjoy. So listen now to another story.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The king of Swarn Desh was a very gracious king. He had four beautiful
                daughters. They all were very tender and delicate. His first daughter was like
                that, if she came out in moonlight, she had blisters on her skin. Her second
                daughter was like that, if any rose flower is thrown at her body, it bled from
                that place where it hit. The third daughter was like that, if anybody spoke a
                little loudly, she became unconscious. And the fourth one was like that if
                somebody touched her, a mark was made at the same place. All princess
                became very famous for their tenderness, even in far countries. Whoever
                heard about them, he got surprised at this.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The first princess was always kept in shade; nobody touched the second one;
                all only whispered in the presence of the third princess; and the fourth
                princess was like the second princess. The king was very much worried about
                their marriage, how they will be married? Will they be able to live after their
                marriage? He was especially worried about the second and the fourth ones.

                &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The king had employed separate maids to take care of them. One of those
                maids was very kind. She used to donate something to a beggar whenever she
                got an opportunity, especially when she went out of the palace.
