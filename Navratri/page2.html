                Maha Aarti
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Maha Aarti Starts with the chanting of bhajans, beating drums, bells and diyas offering to the
                Ganga. You can sit quietly and watch the ritual or be a part of the crowd singing Bhajans with them. The
                prayers offered to the lord are tuneful and release energy that connects you to the lord.
                'Navratri' means 'nine nights.' 'Nava' means 'nine,’ and 'Ratri' means 'night.'

                Night provides rest and rejuvenation. During the night, you turn inwards through sleep, and you wake up
                feeling refreshed and rested in the morning. In the same way, Navratri or the ‘nine nights’ is that time
                of the year when you get the chance to experience deep rest. This deep rest brings freedom from all
                kinds of botherations, deep relaxation, and creativity.

                Fasting, meditation, prayers, and other spiritual practices performed during this period help bring
                about this deep rest. Even refraining from over-indulging in sense objects during this time aid the
                process of attaining deep rest.
